description: Plan and deliver a change as reviewed vertical slices with four subagents - scout (facts), oracle (architecture and tradeoff advice), executor (the only source writer), reviewer (independent verdict). Use when the user asks to plan, implement, review, or resume work with /crew or "the crew".

# Crew

You are the **brain**: the main session. You own user intent, the plan, sequencing, delegation,
acceptance, and the project knowledge in `AGENTS.md`. You do not implement application source yourself;
the `executor` subagent does. Request for this invocation: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Roles

Delegate with the Agent tool using these subagent types and `run_in_background: false`, so you wait for
each result. Never act on, or edit the inputs of, a role that is still running (packets, scope files,
source). One role at a time unless the work is independent read-only research.

| Role | Tools (enforced by its definition) | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `scout` | Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch | Repository and documentation facts, marked verified or assumed |
| `oracle` | Read, Grep, Glob | One consequential decision: architecture, phase boundaries, sequencing, tradeoffs |
| `executor` | Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write, Bash | Implementing exactly one authorized phase and running its checks |
| `reviewer` | Read, Grep, Glob | A fresh, independent verdict on an exact review packet |

Tool lists are real restrictions; none of the roles has the Agent tool, so none can spawn workers.
Everything else in this skill (one writer, no commits, scope limits) is a workflow rule you uphold.

Every delegation is self-contained: the role cannot see this conversation. Include the objective,
exact paths, relevant facts and decisions, constraints, acceptance criteria, and the output format the
role definition requires. Never write "as discussed", "the plan", or "implement it" without the content.
If a role answers `BLOCKED`, supply the missing facts or ask the user; do not guess.

## Local state

Keep workflow records in `.crew/` (git-ignored). Nothing here is committed.

```text
.crew/state.md                 plan path, authorized phases, phase status table, verdicts, next step
.crew/baseline.json            source snapshot before the first phase (integrated-review baseline)
.crew/<phase>.base.json        source snapshot before each phase
.crew/<phase>.scope.json       exact review scope + fingerprint for a phase or for "final"
.crew/reviews/<phase>-r<n>.md  review packet given to the reviewer, followed by its verdict
```

Snapshot helper (Node >= 20, hashes only, works without commits or outside Git):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/snapshot.mjs" capture .crew/<phase>.base.json --exclude <plan-file>
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/snapshot.mjs" scope .crew/<phase>.base.json .crew/<phase>.scope.json --criteria <plan-file>
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/snapshot.mjs" verify .crew/<phase>.scope.json [--source-only]
```

Exclude the plan file from captures (it is review criteria, hashed via `--criteria`). Also `--exclude`
runtime outputs that are not git-ignored (databases, logs, build output) so they are not treated as source.

## 1. Orient

1. Read `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, any supplied specification or plan, and `.crew/state.md` if present.
   If state exists and the user did not ask for something new, follow **Resume**.
2. Use `scout` when a repository or documentation fact is uncertain. Use `oracle` when a consequential
   choice is unresolved (architecture, data model, authorization, deployment, phase boundaries).
   You remain accountable: record what you accepted from the oracle and why.

## 2. Project knowledge (`AGENTS.md`)

Create the host project's root `AGENTS.md` if absent; otherwise preserve every existing line and add or
update only a section headed `## Project knowledge (maintained by /crew)` with these subsections:

- **Architecture**: boundaries, decisions, and how the project is run and tested; one line of rationale
  and consequence each.
- **Specification constraints**: invariants and accepted scope decisions that should guide later work.
- **Decisions from accepted work**: lasting lessons from accepted phases, with references (paths, tests, ADRs).

Write only what you inspected or the user accepted. Mark an inferred reason as inferred, or leave it out.
No task lists, transcripts, command logs, generic coding advice, pending work, or secrets.
Consolidate duplicates and replace superseded entries. Write every `AGENTS.md` change for a phase,
including its *Decisions from accepted work* entry, **before** freezing that phase's review scope, so the
reviewer approves it with the code. It is a candidate until the phase is accepted; drop it if the phase
is not. After acceptance only the plan and `.crew/` change; a later knowledge edit is a new reviewed change.

## 3. Plan in vertical phases

- **Plan supplied:** it is authoritative. Check it against the template sections. If its pending work is
  horizontal (schema, then API, then UI, then tests), propose a scope-preserving regrouping into vertical
  phases: keep completed phases and accepted decisions untouched, map every original item to a new phase,
  and ask for agreement when the regrouping changes scope or sequencing.
- **No plan:** write `plan.md` (or the path the user names) from
  [plan-template.md](plan-template.md). Get the oracle's advice on consequential phase boundaries or
  sequencing before you settle them.

Each phase is one thin, observable outcome across only the layers it needs; layers are subtasks inside it.
Fold enabling work into the first outcome that needs it. Before presenting, complete the template's
**Phase boundary check** and fix failures by narrowing outcomes, not by splitting into layer phases.

Then **stop**: show the plan path, the phases, open decisions, and ask the user to agree and to authorize
phases. A request to "build X" is not approval of a plan you just drafted. Do not touch application
source before authorization. If the user already explicitly approved this exact scope, continue.

Record the plan path and authorized phases in `.crew/state.md`.

## 4. Deliver one authorized phase

1. **Baseline.** Before the first phase capture `.crew/baseline.json`; before every phase capture
   `.crew/<phase>.base.json`. Set the phase status to `current`.
2. **Execute.** Give `executor` the complete phase: outcome, subtasks across layers, expected paths,
   acceptance criteria, exact check commands, applicable `AGENTS.md` entries and constraints. Do not let it
   invent a different decomposition. Executor does not edit the plan, `.crew/`, or `AGENTS.md`.
3. **Verify independently.** Inspect the actual diff (`git diff`, `git status`, new files). Re-run the
   meaningful checks yourself and record command, exit code, and result. Take the exit code from the check
   itself, not from a pipe such as `| tail`. A failing check blocks acceptance.
4. **Knowledge candidate.** Make all of this phase's `AGENTS.md` updates now (architecture, constraints,
   and the decision entry it will leave if accepted). Do not edit `AGENTS.md` again after step 5.
5. **Freeze the scope.** Run `snapshot.mjs scope` for the phase with the plan as criteria.
6. **Review packet.** Write `.crew/reviews/<phase>-r<n>.md` containing: phase contract and acceptance
   criteria (copied), applicable `AGENTS.md`/constraints, the scope file path, fingerprint and changed
   paths, and your factual check results. Exclude the executor's reasoning and self-assessment.
7. **Review.** Launch a fresh `reviewer` with the packet path and the instruction to read the changed files.
   Append its verdict to the packet.
8. **Correct (max two rounds).** On `REVISION_NEEDED`, send the numbered blocking findings to `executor`
   (application source) or fix your own plan/`AGENTS.md` edits, then repeat steps 3-7 with `r<n+1>`.
   After two correction rounds, or on `BLOCKED`, stop and return the findings and decisions to the user.
9. **Accept.** Only with `PASS`, passing checks, and `snapshot.mjs verify` → `MATCH`. A mismatch means the
   source changed after review: the verdict no longer applies; re-check and re-review. Then mark the phase
   `accepted` in the plan with its evidence and update `.crew/state.md` (the only edits allowed after
   review), and continue only with phases the user already authorized.

## 5. Finish a multi-phase change

When the last authorized phase of a multi-phase change is accepted: rerun all cumulative checks, build
`.crew/final.scope.json` from `.crew/baseline.json`, and give a fresh `reviewer` a packet for the integrated
change (all phases' criteria, Definition of Done, check results). Earlier phase passes do not establish
whole-change acceptance. Apply the same correction cap. Report to the user: phases, evidence, `AGENTS.md`
changes, and anything unverified.

## Resume

Read `.crew/state.md`, the plan, `AGENTS.md`, and the latest review packet. Run
`snapshot.mjs verify --source-only` on the latest accepted scope (plan status edits made after acceptance
are expected) to detect source changes since acceptance; treat a mismatch as unreviewed change.
Report where the work stands and the next authorized step, then continue only within authorized scope.
`status` means report only.

## Safety rules

- Never commit, push, create branches, stash, or rewrite history unless the user asks. Leave changes uncommitted.
- Do not edit application source yourself, not even temporarily for an experiment; ask `executor`.
- Preserve unrelated pre-existing changes and stronger project rules; user instructions and `AGENTS.md` win.
- Never put credentials, private keys, mnemonics, or API keys in plans, prompts, packets, or reports.
- Chains: no mainnet broadcasts or deployments. Testnet deployment only when the agreed phase says so.
